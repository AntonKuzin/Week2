In postﬁx notation (or reverse Polish notation) an operation is written directly after its operands. For instance, a sum of two numbers, A + B, is written as A B +. The expression B C + D ∗ means (B + C) ∗D, and A B C + D ∗ + means A + (B + C) ∗D. (Here, we denote the multiplication operation as ∗). An advantage of this notation is that it does not require neither parentheses nor agreements on operators’ priority.
 
Given an expression in postﬁx notation, evaluate it.
Input
The ﬁrst and only line of the input ﬁle contains an expression in postﬁx notation, which can contain single-digit non-negative numbers and operations +, -, ∗. The line contains at most 106 numbers and/or operations. Every two subsequent entities are separated by a single whitespace. It is guaranteed that the expression is correct and is evaluated to a single number.
Output
Output the result of evaluation of this expression. It is guaranteed that the result, as well as any intermediate value, will be less than 231 by the absolute value.
