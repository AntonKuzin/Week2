A sequence A of characters “(”, “)”, “[”, “]” is called a correct bracket sequence, if one of the following is true:
The sequence A is empty.
The ﬁrst character is “(”, and the sequence A contains a character “)”, such that A = (B)C, where B and C are correct bracket sequences.
The ﬁrst character is “[”, and the sequence A contains a character “]”, such that A = [B]C, where B and C are correct bracket sequences.
For example, the sequences “(())” and “()[]” are correct, while the sequences “[)” and “((” are not correct.
 
For every line of the input ﬁle determine whether it is a correct bracket sequence.
Input
The input ﬁle contains at least one and at most 500 lines. Every line contains at least one and at most 104 characters, and there are only four possible characters: “(”, “)”, “[”, “]”. Every line, including the last one, is terminated by a newline sequence.
Output
For every line from the input ﬁle output “YES” if it is a correct bracket sequence, and “NO” otherwise.
